adaptive enemy spawner notes
-will spawn enemies based on how well the player(s) during the level
/game
avg time beat 
 normal, 
 elite, spawn rate .25
 boss spawn rate .1
mob = group of enemies
mob time = time of all enemies in mob
split lvl into spawn points
+---+---+   +---+ m = a specific spawn point
|   |   |   |   | n = total #'s of spawn points
+---+---+...+---+
 1/n 2/n     m/n

player time < mob time
more enemies
upgraded enemies appear more often
normal->elite
elite->boss
more spawn points
player time > mob time
less enemies
upgraded enemies--
less spawn points

Problems:
-need to know specs of partners computer 
so don't crazy
-not enough enemies variety

extra thoughts
-difference between enemy amount,variety,time between groups
when should they change
-do we need to add ammo/health pickup
goal level time to beat enemies(times may change):
time to beat lvl 90 secs
15 secs par per spawn
normal(bears): 1
elite(bunnies): 2
boss(elephant): 4

different attack patterns for each enemies
everything is on fire and this won't work
need some type of damaging model and a way to move the gun around 
to target different areas of the body 

explaination/pitch

-game's difficulty will change based on player perfomance.
-game will track time for players to destory mob
-game will have par time for a group
 par time = total average time for all enemies in a group
-player time lower than par
 -more enemies
 -more spawnpoints
 -harder enemies appear more often
-player time higher than par
 -less enemies
 -less spawnpoints
 -less harder enemies
